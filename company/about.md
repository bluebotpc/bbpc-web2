Hello everyone! My name is Matt Faulkner and I am  the owner of BlueBotPC. I started BlueBotPC in 2015 after I had
graduated from Pickens Technical College in 2015. Over the following 8 years I would go on to work as a Contractor for
a wide range of companies and Government Agencies fullfilling plenty of projects along the way!

I love what I do. I like learning new things and playing with new technologies. When I get to help people and small businesses
like mine meet their goals, it feels even better.
