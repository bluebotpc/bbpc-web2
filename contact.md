## About Us

**Our Mission** is to provide honest and quality PC Repair, Network Support, and Professional Services to our local community.

### Our History

BlueBotPC was started in Aurora, Colorado as a PC Repair shop in 2015 after Matt Graduated from Pickens Technical College. We have performed contract-work for the [Department of Veteran Affairs](https://www.va.gov/), [Raytheon](https://careers.rtx.com/global/en/raytheon-aurora-co-location), and [Humanscale](https://www.humanscale.com/). In 2022 we moved to Lone Tree, Colorado and built our first small scale Data Center offering Game Server Hosting such as Minecraft and Terraria. In July 2023 we relocated to North Dakota for new opportunities!
