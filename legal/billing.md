All repairs that require in-depth troubleshooting are subject to an non-refundable **$50.00 Diagnostics Fee**. This covers 1 hour of troubleshooting time. Work requiring more than 1 hour is subject to a **$50.00 per hour flat rate** after the diagnostics time has ended.

Customer Orders over $500 will require a non-refundable 20% deposit.

**Dispatch Billing Transparency:** On-Site Technician Dispatch will result in an additional fee of $0.75/mile from our Garage. Dispatch outside of our normal operating hours will result in a $100 Truck Roll fee.

**On-Site Support Statement:** Customers are responsible for maintaining a safe working environment for our Technicians. Technicians may refuse service due to safety concerns. Our Technicians may wear a face-covering/mask upon request. Billable hours start once our Technician arrives at your address.

**Final Amendment:** We have Industry experience, certifications, and education. We will make our best judgment call on a case by case basis. All problems and concerns can be resolved by communicating with Matt.
