## Custom PC Build Warranty

Full-Build computers are backed by a 1-Year warranty. Guaranteed to be free of hardware and assembly defects. We will replace failed components with equal/equally-priced components at no cost to you. This is void if the PC is used for Crypto-mining or if there is evidence of water/liquid damage. Leaks from a BlueBotPC installed Water AIO loop are covered under most circumstances. Contact Matt directly for warranty support.
