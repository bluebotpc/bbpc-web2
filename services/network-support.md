### Wireless Site Survey - $100

Having trouble with wireless connectivity? Provide us with a floor map and we will help you determine areas of weak wireless coverage. Don't have a floor map? No problem, we will work together to come up with a solution. This service includes a 7-point signal strength survey using [Homedale](https://the-sz.com/products/homedale/) or similar tooling. We will provide a 1-page overview for the recommended actions to improve wireless coverage.
