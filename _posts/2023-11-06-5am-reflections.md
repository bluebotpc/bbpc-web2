I was raised by four amazing women. All exceptional, remarkable, and notable in their ways. This undoubtedly gave me an advantage interacting with girls in high school. For better or worse, back then everyone knew me as a lady's man. It's funny because now-a-days I fumble with words and eye contact with women. I digress.

In the last decade of commitment to Ruby I can honestly say that I am better from it. She has taught me to be open-minded. Together we have argued about it all. We've called each other everything in the proverbial book. However at the end of the day, we solved our problem together. We found a middle ground.

Cooperation and Compromise are words that come to mind.

These problem-solving skills that we have developed together have done more than open my mind.  They have humbled me. Today I am thankful to wake up; with a loving wife; a healthy daughter; a roof over my head; bills paid; and food on the table.

I have learned to apologize. I've learned that mistakes are just part of our life. Even when I think it's all under-control and well thought out, the world might have a different idea for me. Murphy's Law per se. Although I do not see Murphy's Law as an excuse. Instead it's just a force of life.

To wrap up my 5AM reflection... We have choices. We can change; we can, we must grow. Like a seedling evolves into a beautiful flowering plant.

I've written this while thinking about my dear Brother. He has recently become a young Father and I hear he is struggling. I hope he finds guidance, courage, and strength.
