Hello everyone! I've created a walk-thru video on the basics of setting up a brand new headless Raspberry Pi.

More specifically I show you how to...

Image an microSD card using both Raspberry Pi Imager & BalenaEtcher. Pick your preferred method...

Create an SSH file to enable SSH access on initial boot up.

How to create a wpa_supplicant.conf file to enable wireless connectivity on boot up.

How to find your new Raspberry Pi on your network using NMAP

How to connect to your Raspberry Pi for the first time using PuTTY

If the video helped you, please consider leaving a like or a comment. Also if you have an constructive criticism I'd love to hear it so that I can create better videos in the future.
