Hello everyone! I've created a walk-thru video on the basics of setting up a brand new headless Raspberry Pi.

More specifically I show you how to...

- Image an microSD card using both [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) & [BalenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/). Pick your preferred method...
- Create an SSH file to enable SSH access on initial boot up.
- How to create a wpa_supplicant.conf file to enable wireless connectivity on boot up.
- How to find your new Raspberry Pi on your network using [NMAP](https://nmap.org/)
- How to connect to your Raspberry Pi for the first time using [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/)

If the video helped you, please consider leaving a like or a comment. Also if you have an constructive criticism I'd love to hear it so that I can create better videos in the future.
