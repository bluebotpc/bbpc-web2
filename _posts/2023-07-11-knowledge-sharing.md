I've had the pleasure of working in the IT (Information Technology) industry for almost a Decade. That in itself is crazy for me to think about. Looking back at where I was knowledge-wise when I created my first Minecraft server, then fast forward to my first day in a IT Support role within a Hospital. Fast forward again and I am the Senior Technician on a Tier 3 Escalations team.

It took time and dedication to get here. It took other folks mentorship and goodwill to educate me in all aspects of my life. Anyways, I am not a life coach but I can happily share with you my collection of Study Guides and other resources I have bought from various Humble Bundle Book Bundles.
